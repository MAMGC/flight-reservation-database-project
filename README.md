# flight-reservation-database-project
Final project of course Design of Software System.
World Plane, Inc. (hereafter identified as WPI) serves people as an flight ticket reservation company. It has its own airline flight system, but once it relied on the Travel Agency airline reservation system. WPI decided to develop a small scaled application for customer by Java language, so that customers can order flight on WPIâ€™s Retail Customer airline reservation System.
Scope of the system
This system offers help for customers to create airline reservations with World Plane, Inc.. Also, the system supports sorting flights by either price or time. In addition, the system is to support both one way and round trip flights, initially queryable by departure date. Lastly, when reserving the seat, the system will support selection of which class the seat belongs to and etc.
